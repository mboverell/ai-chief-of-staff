## Week 1 (December 2024)

**Initial release.**

- Design principles established: progressive disclosure, separation of concerns, constrained output
- Templates created for context files

**What's working:**
- Infrastructure is solid — agent finds files correctly
- Coach voice produces useful output

**Open questions:**
- Does reading integration add signal or noise?
- Will the reflections feedback loop improve output over time?
- How much trajectory context is optimal?
- Will weekly review usage sustain or decay?
