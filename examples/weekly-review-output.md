## 🔭 Weekly Review (generated 2025-01-17)

### The Week at a Glance
- **Meetings:** 14 (themes: planning/strategy, 1:1s, interviews)
- **Open loops:** 6 items surfaced
- **Priorities:** 3 of 5 got meaningful progress
- **Energy signal:** Running hot

### Trajectory (last 2-3 weeks)
The planning intensity continues from Week 2. You noted feeling "stretched but focused" last week, and this week doubled down on strategic work (roadmap, board prep). Energy is high but there's a pattern forming: personal priorities are consistently deprioritized. The annual physical has been on the list for three weeks.

### What I'm Seeing

This was a productive week by work metrics. The roadmap session happened, the board deck is in good shape, and you're moving fast on Q1 setup. The 14 meetings suggest high engagement but also leaves little room for deep work—worth watching as Q1 execution ramps up.

The budget review didn't happen. It's the second week this has slipped. You mentioned in Tuesday's finance sync that you'd "get to it this week," but it's Friday and it's still open. This matches a pattern from your `how-i-work` notes: you tend to defer financial/admin work when strategic work is available. Not inherently bad, but the pattern is visible.

Personal priorities are struggling. The annual physical has been rolling forward since Week 1. The family trip happened (good), but that was already booked—it didn't require activation energy. The pattern of "personal priorities that require scheduling get dropped" is showing up again.

The coffee with Marcus is interesting. You don't normally take networking meetings mid-quarter. Worth asking: was this exploratory (thinking about something?), or just opportunistic?

### What You Saved This Week

- [The Art of Strategic Neglect](https://example.com/article-1) — First Round Review
- [How Top Execs Manage Energy, Not Time](https://example.com/article-2) — HBR
- [Building in Public: A Founder's Guide](https://example.com/article-3) — Lenny's Newsletter
- [The Case for Slowing Down](https://example.com/article-4) — The Atlantic

*Heavy on productivity and pacing. When you're saving articles about "slowing down" while running at 14 meetings/week, something is trying to surface.*

### Open Loops

- [ ] Review budget proposal from finance — *from Finance Sync (Tue)*
- [ ] Send interview feedback to recruiting — *from Interview: Ops Role (Thu)*
- [ ] Follow up with Marcus on intro he mentioned — *from Coffee with Marcus (Wed)*
- [ ] Schedule annual physical — *from personal priorities (rolling)*
- [ ] Share roadmap draft with engineering leads — *from Product Roadmap Session (Thu)*
- [ ] Confirm board deck final review time with CEO — *from Board Deck Review (Fri)*

### The Questions

*If I were your exec coach, I'd be asking:*

1. "The budget review has slipped two weeks. What's actually blocking it—time, or something else?"

2. "You're saving articles about slowing down while running full speed. What would it look like to actually slow down for one week?"

3. "The coffee with Marcus—was that just a catch-up, or are you exploring something you haven't named yet?"

### My Take (2025-01-17)

**Valid observations:**
- The budget review call-out is fair. I'm avoiding it because I know there's a hard conversation coming.
- Personal priority pattern is real—I need to actually calendar-block these.

**Missing context:**
- Marcus meeting was about a potential advisory role he's considering me for. Didn't want to write it down until it's more concrete.

**Wrong read:**
- Energy isn't "running hot" in a bad way—I actually feel good this week. The meeting count is high but they were the right meetings.
